title: 'Poisson Lognormal models for multivariate count data'
description: |
  In many fields of life science, count data is becoming the standard, like abundance table in ecology and micrbiology, or single-cell data in molecular biology. The Poisson lognormal model is a latent model that describes the dependency structure of the data in an underlying Gaussian layer, while the observation layer of the count is Poisson distributed. As such, it offers the flexibility of the multivariate Gaussian distribution while preserving count distributions. <br/>
  In the R package *PLNmodels*, we implement an efficient varitional strategy for inferring the standard Poisson lognormal model. We derive a series of model by transposing the classical tools from multivariate analysis, mostly tight to the Gaussian assumption of the data, to count data. *PLNmodels* includes variants for Principal Component Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, sparse covariance estimation _a.k.a._ network inference, mixture models and more coming, all designed for multivariate count data. <div class='altmetric-embed' data-badge-type='donut' data-doi="10.1007/s11222-010-9191-2"></div>

### The Poisson log-normal model

The family of models available in the package belongs to the family of probabilistic PCA models, where the observation are not necessarily Gaussian.  In particular, we consider that observations are drawn from a Poisson lognormal distribution.

The Poisson lognormal model relates some $p$-dimensional observation vectors $\mathbf{Y}_i$ to some  $p$-dimensional vectors of Gaussian latent variables $\mathbf{Z}_i$ as follows
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pca-model}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
  \text{latent space } &   \mathbf{Z}_i \sim \mathcal{N}{\boldsymbol\mu},\boldsymbol\Sigma) \\
  \text{observation space } &  Y_{ij} | Z_{ij} \quad \text{indep.} & Y_{ij} | Z_{ij} \sim \mathcal{P}\left(\exp\{Z_{ij}\}\right)
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

The parameter ${\boldsymbol\mu}$ corresponds to the main effects and the latent covariance matrix $\boldsymbol\Sigma$ describes the underlying structure of dependence between the $p$ variables.
