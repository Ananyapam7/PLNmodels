Submitting PLNmodels version 1.0.0 to CRAN, motivated by a request from CRAN team (HTML5)

## Breaking changes

* interface for controlling the fits now use list generated by dedicated functions
   - PLN_param() for PLN
   - PLNLDA_param() for PLNLDA
   - PLNnetwork_param() for PLNnetwork
   - PLNPCA_param() for PLNPCA
   - PLNmixture_param() for PLNmixture
The use of 'control = list()' is deprecated: the code stop and send an error.

* The regression coefficients are now denoted by B, not Theta, such as B = t(Theta).
  We keep on sending back Theta as a field of myPLN$model_par$Theta, but this will soon be deprecated

* We have lowered the tolerance thresholds for the convergence of the optimization algorithms: 
  the adjustment is sometimes a little longer, but more precise and more often reaches the global minimum

## New features

* added Barents fish data set
* support for PLN when (inverse) covariance is known/fixed
* estimator of the variance of the model parameters 
    * integration of sandwich estimator fo the variance-covariance of Theta when Sigma is fixed
    * variational estimation of the variance-covariance based on variational approximation of the Fisher information 
    * jackknife estimation of the variance of Theta and Sigma
    * bootstrap estimation of the variance of Theta and Sigma
* handle list of penalty weights in PLNnetwork
* first support for torch optimizers (for PLN and PLNLDA)

## Bug fixes

* fix in objective functions of ve_step of standard PLN models
* fix in objective functions of main  of standard PLN models
